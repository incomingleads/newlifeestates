    <h1>About US</h1>
  </div>
  <div class="col-12 col-lg-4 mb-3">
    <p>
      WE ARE ONE OF THE FIRST AGENCIES who created the PAY MONTHLY TERMS for the selling of properties. This is because we are flexible with the terms and the negotiations are made directly with us (being the owners of these properties). This method of selling gives more opportunity for clients with limited budget to fulfill their dream of owning a property in Bulgaria.
    </p>
    <p>
      ITâ€™S OUR BELIEF that clients deserve to be treated in a friendly and approachable manner and we therefore provide a personal service. Our emphasis is on efficiency and communication. If an issue is within our control we will deal with it quickly, or alternatively, keep you informed regarding matters involving third parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      WE ARE A BULGARIAN-BASED and owned estate company with our own team of builders and network of local agents. This enables us to offer flexible service and lower commissions.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOT ONLY do we offer the sale of real estates, but the entire decision for you, your family and your business.
    </p>
    <p>
      LET US WELCOME YOU AS OUR CUSTOMER!
